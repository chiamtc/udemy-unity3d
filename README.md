### Explore game development with Unity (version 2017)
Gitignore file ignores 
- **Assets/Models** 
- **Assets/Texture** 

...due to filesize. I only upload necessary scripts and files.

#### Game 1 - Golem and Pumpkin
**Description** : Move golem with **A/left key** and **D/right key** to dodge pumpkins (random generated) in a slanted floor. Pumpkin touches golem and game is over. No win condition as this is an intro.

**Resources** : Premade texture and models from the course
